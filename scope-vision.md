As noted in the meeting summary of the 2016 Systems Approaches to Cancer Biology meeting, "Cancer systems biology [CSB] aims to understand cancer as an integrated system of genes, proteins, networks, and interactions rather than an entity of isolated molecular and cellular components….the field is not defined by a particular set of methods, nor simply by the application of computational methods to cancer data. Rather, the field is defined by a recognition that cancer is a dynamic, multifactorial, and complex process that must be understood using both experimental methods and analytical approaches that bridge traditional disciplinary boundaries to directly address these concomitant challenges." (https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-16-1580)
 
Although we purposefully use broad criteria to define this field, we choose to limit the scope based on some specific criteria. An important facet of CSB research is that it examines multiple biological scales, potentially including molecules, networks, tumor cells, the tumor itself, the tumor microenvironment, entire organisms, and populations. Thus research that focuses solely on one of these facets may not fall within the realm of CSB. For example, research that focuses solely on population genetics of cancer development may not fall under the scope of CSB unless it also uses experimental or analytical techniques to derive insights about the mechanisms of cancer biology and/or how such mechanisms influence cancer development. Similarly, research that focuses on algorithm development but does not provide insights about cancer biology or cancer systems may not fall under the scope of CSB. What else…?
