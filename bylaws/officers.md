## From Steve


The Association of Early Career Cancer System Biologists (AECCSB) is led by two co-chairs. The co-chairs are responsible for overseeing organizational operations and finances, advising conference committees, enforcing rules and regulations, and advising other leaders within the organization. As needed, the co-chairs hold periodic meetings (by phone, electronically, or in person) that can be attended by the general membership of AECCSB. After proposing a new rule or regulation, they use an electronic form to elicit a vote from all eligible and registered members of AECCSB.
 
Each co-chair serves for a term of two years. An election is held each year to elect one new co-chair, who replaces the currently longest-serving co-chair. This approach is designed to support continuity of leadership.
 
An elections will be held in November of each year, starting in 2018. The new co-chair will begin service on January 1 of the following year.
 
The co-chairs may hold elections for additional leadership positions that they deem necessary to support organizational operations. These positions may include titles and responsibilities such as the following:
 
Conference Organizing Committee (appoint conference co-chairs and coordinate administrative and scientific tasks related to the SACB conference)
Treasurer (oversee finances of the organization)
Advertising (promote the organization's mission and activities, such as via a social-media presence)
Secretary (take notes at meetings, track to-do items, etc.)
 
The AECCSB seeks to promote diversity in leadership. Thus we encourage participation from individuals from different institutions, geographical locations, research specialties, and demographics.
