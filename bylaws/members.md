## From Steve

As the Association for Early Career Cancer Systems Biologists (AECCSB), we aim to support early-career researchers who participate in research related to cancer systems biology. We use the same criteria as the U.S. National Institutes of Health to define early-career (new investigator) status. Accordingly, we define an early-career researcher as someone who is within 10 years of completing their terminal research degree or their medical residency from an accredited academic research institution. However, we also include researchers who are currently pursuing a terminal research degree.
 
Membership shall not be denied anyone based on criteria such as race, ethnicity, age, sex (including gender identity or sexual orientation), religion, or disability. We reserve the right to revoke membership of anyone who does not abide by the AECCSB's rules and regulations.
