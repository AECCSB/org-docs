# Association of Early Career Cancer Systems Biologists

This document describes how Association of Early Career Cancer Systems Biologists organizes itself.

## Our Mission

As the Association for Early Career Cancer Systems Biologists (AECCSB), we aim to support early-career researchers who participate in research related to cancer systems biology. This occurs through a biennial scientific meeting, educational outreach, and advocacy within the scientific community.

## Roles in AECCSB

The AECCSB is led by two **co-chairs**. The co-chairs are responsible for overseeing organizational operations and finances, advising conference committees, enforcing rules and regulations, and advising other leaders within the organization. As needed, the co-chairs hold periodic meetings (by phone, electronically, or in person) that can be attended by the general membership of AECCSB. After proposing a new rule or regulation, they use an electronic form to elicit a vote from all eligible and registered members of AECCSB.

Each co-chair serves for a term of two years. An election is held each year to elect one new co-chair, who replaces the currently longest-serving co-chair. This approach is designed to support continuity of leadership. Elections are held in November of each year, starting in 2018. The new co-chair will begin service on January 1 of the following year.

The co-chairs may hold elections for additional **committee positions** that they deem necessary to support organizational operations. These positions may include titles and responsibilities such as the following:

- Conference Organizing Committee (appoint conference co-chairs and coordinate administrative and scientific tasks related to the SACB conference)
- Treasurer (oversee finances of the organization)
- Advertising (promote the organization's mission and activities, such as via a social-media presence)
- Secretary (take notes at meetings, track to-do items, etc.)

The AECCSB seeks to promote diversity in leadership. Thus we encourage participation from individuals from different institutions, geographical locations, research specialties, and demographics.

**Members** are any eligible early-career investigators who have chosen to become affiliated with AECCSB. We use the same criteria as the U.S. National Institutes of Health to define early-career (new investigator) status. Accordingly, we define an early-career researcher as someone who is within 10 years of completing their terminal research degree or their medical residency from an accredited academic research institution. However, we also include researchers who are currently pursuing a terminal research degree. Membership shall not be denied anyone based on criteria such as race, ethnicity, age, sex (including gender identity or sexual orientation), religion, or disability. We reserve the right to revoke membership of anyone who does not abide by the AECCSB's rules and regulations. Both co-chairs and committee positions should be held by active members.
