### Discussion points for today

##### Should we remain an early career organization? 
We are aging out of early career status, even if some grants define as 10 years post PhD. We have a lot of momentum but want to get fresh blood. Doug wants to make sure that early career needs are continually met. 
Are we the association OF early career people? Or FOR early career people. Suggestion is to maintain fixed ratio of the early to late career scientists.

To bring in members:
* need a list/recognition for early scientists to show they are members
* what are requirements of members?
* Newsletter every other month to make sure people know they are members. Stacey brought up her own society - quarterly electronic newsletter that brings out members. Support/promote early career. Designated editors. 
* Promote members' papers as they are published. 
* Afshin suggested analysis working group to do something as a grass roots effort, focusing on a specific problem. 
* Database of members, annual check in/membership coordinator. Directory of expertise. Wiki/table. 
* Tiered membership - mentors and/or drivers

##### Elections
We have 2 co-chairs, 1 returning, 1 open. Meeting committee: 4 returning members, 4 new members. Changes occur every 4 years. 
Nominate yourself at election@sacbmeeting.org - everyone should run for this position. 

How much time is meeting committee? 2-4 hours a week in the past year leading up to the meeting. Need the co-chairs to be devoted. 

Are there other positions/endeavors. 

### Summary
* We *should* stay a career organization
* We need to maintain more formal membership - directory structure.
* Need to run a meeting!
* We should create more formal structure surrounding outreach - social media and/or newsletter
